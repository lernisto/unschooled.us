The term *maverick* has a well-established meaning "independent minded." The origin of this usage is interesting.

> George M. Maverick recounted that in 1845, Mr. [Samuel] Maverick acquired some 400 head of cattle that he, whose interest was in real estate, did not want in payment of a debt to him by a neighbor of $1,200, leaving the cattle to be managed by an African American family. The cattle were subsequently moved from the Gulf Coast to the Conquista Ranch on the San Antonio River, still under the management of the same family, and left to multiply, graze, and wander away. Perhaps one-third were branded, and the caretakers apparently made no great effort to keep up with them and may have willfully neglected the branding in order that they might not be readily sold and themselves deprived of their easy position. The wanderings were such that in 1856, the herd could be estimated as numbering the same 400. Others in the area, though being aware that the unbranded estrayed cattle were likely Maverick's, followed the range convention of the time and burned their own brands into the "mavericks," as they had come to refer to the unmarked cattle. Mr. Maverick had little interest in the cattle, and Mrs. Maverick's appendix contains a number of letters advising him of the state of his herd. A Mr. Leo J. Toutant followed up on his own father's earlier offer to purchase Maverick's herd, and in 1856 did so himself. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Maverick)


Also interesting are Mr. Maverick's education (home schooled) and the roles he played in the history of Texas, the lone star state, which declared and won its independence from Mexico and voluntarily joined the United States of America by treaty (not by conquest).


Similarly, unschoolers are independent minded. But we do not rebel for the sake of rebellion. We may participate in public school activities *when they serve our interests*. As Mr. Maverick left his cattle unbranded simply because they were not something he cared about, we may opt out of certain "mainstream" activities simply because we have better things to do with our time. We don't hate school: we love life.

Blah.
